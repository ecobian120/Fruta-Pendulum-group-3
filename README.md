# Fruta-Pendulum-group-3
Fruta Pendulum group 3 project <br> 
Group project:  <br> 
All group files and code will be posted here in regards to the project<br>

<b><strong>Project Deliverables</strong></b><br> 
-Present project and build a webpage that contains all deliverables. <br> 
-Mathematical model of the system. <br> 
-control system should be provided via simulink, stateflow, or other highlievel programming language. <br> 
-System will have a simulation with the control system and mathematical model by connecting Coppelia sim to 
 MATLAB, simulink, or whatever programming landscape is used<br> 

# Introduction

For this project we will be designing a mathematical model used to design a self balancing Furuta Pendulum. For this design Coppelia Sim, MATLAB and Simulink will be used for the software programs.
