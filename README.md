# Introduction

For this project we will be designing a mathematical model used to design a self balancing Furuta Pendulum. For this design SolidWorks, MATLAB and Simulink will be used for the software programs.<br> 

For the project, an inverted pendulum will be develped and control the pendulum arm in its upright position by apply a torque to respond to a distrubance through a motor in the rotary arm. The repository will contain all of the devliverables as mentioned above.

# Conclusion 

An operational viewpoint was defined for the Furuta Pendulum. Thus we created a logical diagram to show the procedural steps for how the system should work. With this logical diagram we were able to derive a mathematical model to use for the two degrees of freedom in our system. These degrees of freedom were the X-Y plane and the Z plane. For our equations of motion we used the equations used for conservation of energy and center of mass. With the mathematical model used, the variables and constants were placed into Matlab and Solidworks to create a 3D simulation of the system.
